<h2>Gait Driven Inertial Navigation Dataset</h2>

<p align="justify">The following installations are required to run the scripts and reproduce the results presented here and in the paper. Given scripts for creating the <b>pyshoe</b> virtual environment have worked successfully on various Windows systems, although we cannot guarantee compatibility with all system configurations.</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Note:</b> The Anaconda virtual environment is named <b>pyshoe</b> because initially our research of developing a stride and heading system (SHS) was completely based on <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8533770">PyShoe study</a> and <a href="https://ieee-dataport.org/open-access/university-toronto-foot-mounted-inertial-navigation-dataset">public dataset</a> made by Brandon Wagstaff <i>et al.</i>. Despite the transition to using exclusively self-collected data and building own inertial odometry public dataset, the original name was retained.</p>

<h3>Inertial Navigation System (INS) vs. Stride & Heading System</h3>

<p align="justify">In the field of indoor positioning & navigation, in general, INS stands for studies that work with inertial sensor data samples that produce sample-wise location estimation. Robert Harle first defined the stride-wise dead-reckoning method as SHS in his <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6407455">indoor inertial positioning systems for pedestrians survey paper</a> in 2013. Recently, Fu <i>et al.</i> introduced <b>sampling frequency driven</b> and <b>gait driven</b> methods titles for INS and SHS, respectively, in their <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9918136">AI survey paper on pedestrian navigation with wearable inertial sensors</a>.</p>

<h3>Installing <b>liegroups</b> package</h3>

<p align="justify">After cloning this repository to your local computer, you must install <b><a href="https://github.com/utiasSTARS/liegroups" target="_blank">liegroups</a></b> package if you would like to reproduce the results shown here in this repo or the paper.</p>

<h3>PyShoe Vicon Room Experiments - Annotation & Corrections</h3>

<p align="justify">We aim to form a <b>gait-driven inertial navigation system (INS)</b> from VICON room experiments of PyShoe dataset where VICON room experiments are sample-wise annotated pedestrian trajectories. Stride indexes would later be required for training various data-driven SHS.</p>

<p align="justify">Here, some troublesome experiments are shown to understand Zero Velocity (ZV) interval and stride detection problems. The optimal ZV detectors are selected (e.g., SHOE for experiment 4, ARED for experiment 6) with the corresponding optimal threshold values (optimal values are supplied by Wagstaff <i>et. al.</i> in the structure of the mat files for VICON room experiments of PyShoe dataset) for all VICON room experiments.</p>

<p align="justify">The process depicted below is the ZV interval and stride index annotation (or correction) of some troublesome trajectories produced in VICON room experiments (PyShoe dataset). Eventually, ZV interval and stride index detection errors in VICON data are fixed. Extracted dataset is going to be used in training various modern SHS as mentioned above.</p>

<p align="justify">Please use <b>detect_missed_strides.m</b> located at <b>data/vicon/processed</b> if you like to reproduce the figures related to ZV interval annotation & correction.</p>

<h4>VICON Room Experiments - Experiment 4 (2017-11-22-11-25-20) Annotation</h4>

<p align="justify">When carefully tracked starting from the initial stride, one can see that the 10<sup>th</sup> stride is not detected in the trajectory plot shown below. To detect the missed ZV interval(s), supplementary ZUPT detectors such as VICON, ARED, MBGTD or AMVD can be utilized. In general, VICON detector was able to generate ZV labels correctly; therefore, in many cases, only VICON ZUPT detector is used as the supplementary detector.</p>

The corrected ground-truth data (as a sample-wise and a stride & heading system trajectory) and ZV signals can be seen below. Note that the annotation is only going to be used in extracting x-y axes displacement (or displacement and heading change) values for LLIO training dataset generation; therefore, corrected ZV labels are not used in any trajectory generation.</p>

<p align="justify">Thus far, due to some undetected steps in VICON room experiments data (recall that Wagstaff <i>et. al.</i> conducted crawling motion experiments in PyShoe) and self-collected data, we examined 56 experiments coarsely in the training dataset <i><b>(i)</b></i> to correct for undetected steps (they are classified as 0 in ZV signal plot despite them actually being 1, i.e., it is false-negative) and <i><b>(ii)</b></i> to exclude motions like crawling, which are not of type bipedal locomotion. As can be seen above, experiments {4, 6, 11, 18, 30, 32, 36, 38, 43} are corrected with ZV interval and stride index annotations by utilizing supplementary detectors. In <b>vicon_data.py</b> file, right before processing experimental data in a loop, annotated experiments are tagged as -1 as follows:</p>

```
training_data_tag = [1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, -1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1]
```

<p align="justify">where</p>

```
len(training_data_tag) = 56
```

<p align="justify">In the signal processing main loop (where the loop visits each experiment one by one), experiments are accepted as training data for LLIO according to the absolute values of given tags. In other words, experiments labeled as 1's directly satisfy conditions while the ones labeled as -1s needed corrections on ZV intervals and stride indexes in order to be included in LLIO training dataset. On the other hand, 0s stand for eliminated experiments due to being nonbipedal locomotion data or unrecoverable errors in ZV intervals and/or stride indexes (we actually emailed Brandon Wagstaff about motion types of experiments yet no documentation was made regarding the motion types (e.g., walking, running, crawling) in the experiments at the time of PyShoe dataset generation). In the decision of labeling an experiment as 0, trajectory (spatial) plots along with IMU data (time series) plots with stride indexes are coarsely examined by using MATLAB and Python environments. Eventually, the elimination of VICON room data yielded a shrink in the total traveled distance by the pedestrian, which negatively affected LLIO training to produce a robust data-driven INS. Therefore, additional training data was required in LLIO training. The next section describes dataset expansion/enlargement process.</p>

<h3>Training Dataset Expansion/Enlargement for LLIO</h3>

<p align="justify">Here PyShoe (pre-trained LSTM based INS) is applied on our own-collected data for stride index extraction, which is required for LLIO training. In the experiments, we used <a href="https://www.microstrain.com/sites/default/files/applications/files/3dm-gx5-25_datasheet_8400-0093_rev_n.pdf">3DM-GX5-25</a> Lord Microstrain IMU with the sensor data capture software <a href="https://www.microstrain.com/software/sensorconnect">SensorConnect</a>. Notice that the employed IMU is of the same brand (and the family as well) that is used in PyShoe experiments. In this regard, expanded data are expected to be compatible with VICON room data in terms of data properties (e.g., distribution of data).</p>

<p align="justify">Experiments conducted here are manually <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/xl6szvjqfh129hxdpxas4/AGWk_iRdc8VASGbUhnKX1Vw?rlkey=9sbdq6vkctspe633cvb5a1jdh&st=gcj793t0&dl=0">annotated by using a ruler</a>. As the VICON room walks/experiments of PyShoe dataset is characteristically very different than hallway traversals, proposed <a href="https://github.com/mtahakoroglu/LLIO">LLIO</a> system required a bigger dataset that accounts for straight walk gait characteristics (at various walking paces). Additionally, realistic experiments (e.g., faster motion, change in speed) are conducted to make the dataset more diverse and thereby the developed data-driven INS more robust.</p>

<p align="justify">Similar to the notation used for VICON room experiments, the start point is called as stride #0, i.e., initial stride. If <b>vicon_data.py</b> is viewed, one can see that ZV labels are (intuitively) filtered for accurate stride index detection. However, the filtered ZV values are not used in the trajectory generation. In other words, the pedestrian trajectories are obtained with the raw (not filtered) LSTM based PyShoe generated ZV labels while the strides that are visualized on the trajectories with marker <b>x</b> correspond to the last index of the ZV intervals of the filtered ZV signals (i.e., stride index).</p>

<p align="justify">As all strides produced a foot-print on the ground that are later measured to form ground-truth data for the experiments, each stride location is called a Ground Control Point (GCP).</p>

<p align="justify"><b>Note:</b> One can run <b>own_data.py</b> to obtain the same results shown below. To learn more about experiment info and results, one can view <b>output.txt</b> log file (located at <b>results/figs/own</b>) recorded while the code was running.</p>

<h3>Experimental Test Results (Own Sensor Data)</h3>

Also, in some experiments correct number of strides are not detected (with LSTM based robust ZV detector). These experiments are not used in evalation as well. However, in future, if a better ZV interval detector can be developed and detect all strides without missing any, then mentioned experiments could be involved in evaluation process.</p>
